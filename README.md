To design a football engine that can be used in backend for modern football games.<br/>
**Machake rahenge \m/**

Will be applying at least three [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

###Why GOF?
GOF stands for Game Of Football.<br/>
You must note that a consistent classification of patterns for common design problems are provided by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, also known as the Gang of Four, GOF. The Gang of Four (GOF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns, another reason being GOF.<br/>
We also happen to be a team of four, this coincidence happens to be another lame reason.

###Language
**Python \m/**

###Design patterns
* [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)<br/>
* [Strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)<br/>
* [Decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)<br/>
maybe more...

###Credits
Inspired by Anoop's [article](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12183/Design-Your-Soccer-Engine-and-Learn-How-To-Apply-D) in CodeProject. <br/>
Learning motive being implementing various design patterns for object oriented system in Python.<br/>
